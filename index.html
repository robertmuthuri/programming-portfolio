    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I consider myself a <strong>life-long learner</strong> whose motiving comes from trying to understand how we can apply technology to solve the problems of regulatory compliance. That said, I have a background in technology and innovation with a particular focus on the regulation of startups.</p>
    <p>My hope is that by joining the Moringa programme, I can gain enough expertise to inform the said focus.</p>
